      <p>During Summer 2016, I worked as a Technology Summer Analyst at Morgan Stanley. I worked with the C++ tooling &amp; performance analysis team. My project involved using a container-management platform -- similar to Docker -- to parallelize suites of unit tests. The project resulted in a 2x speedup of testing time on our team's current unit tests, but more importantly it majorly improved the way our test-time scaled -- the limiting factor became the length of our longest test suite plus overhead required for our container-manager to schedule and set up our container. Next I worked with the current owners of an in-house testing framework to integrate the project and apply it firmwide. Primarily used Python, C++.</p>

      <p>During the 2015-2016 school year, I worked as a Web Developer at Eduware. The main project I worked on involved a major code refactor to change class-dates from general semesters, i.e. fall, spring, summer semester, to a specific start and end dates. This involved changes to our MySQL DB and many parts of our website dependant on this feature. I also worked extensively on developing teaching-resource tools on the site, with a focus on tools for students to edit classes and take online tests. Primarily used C#, Javascript / JQuery, LINQ (SQL Queries), ASP.NET Web Forms.</p>

      <p>During Summer 2015, I worked at as a Software Engineering Intern at General Electric Transportation. I worked with the Heavy-Haul Locomotive Software Team, primarily on locomotive software simulation. My project involved developing &amp; improving a pre-existing tool to remotely load software into the simulation lab for testing. This allowed developers who wanted to run testing to load &amp; begin running the tests from their desks, rather than having to physically walk to the lab. I also helped develop tools for testing automation to simulate a locomotive operator. Primarily used PHP, C++, Bash Scripting, Python.</p>

      <p>Over the 2014-2015 school year, I worked at Stony Brook University.
      For the first half of the school year, I worked as a tutor for PHY 131 -- Introductory Physics. I covered topics including mechanics, wave motion, and kinetic theory. Generally students would come to me with non-homework problems from their textbook, and I would help walk them through how it is done using socratic probing and other teaching methods. 
      Next I worked as a Lab TA for CSE 114 -- Introduction to Java. The lab covered fundamental object oriented concepts in Java. Meeting twice a week, students would be assigned a lab to demonstrate understanding of topics covered. My role was to help students with any uncertainty about the material or the lab itself.</p>
