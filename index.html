        <p>During Summer 2016, I worked as a Technology Summer Analyst at Morgan Stanley with the C++ Tooling &amp; Performance Analysis Team. My project involved using a containerization platform &mdash; similar to Docker &mdash; to parallelize suites of unit tests on multiple machines. The project resulted in a 2x speedup of testing time on our team's current group of unit tests, but more importantly it majorly improved the way our test-time scaled &mdash; the limiting factor for testing time became the length of our longest test suite. Next I worked with the current owners of an in-house testing framework to integrate the project and apply it firmwide. Primarily used Python, C++.</p>

        <p>During the 2015-2016 school year, I worked as a Web Developer at Eduware. The main project I worked on involved a major code refactor to change class-dates from general semesters, i.e. fall, spring, summer semester, to specific start and end dates. This involved making changes to our MySQL DB and many parts of our website dependant on this feature. I also worked extensively on developing teaching-resource tools for the site, with a focus on tools for students to edit classes and take online tests. Primarily used C#, Javascript / JQuery, LINQ (SQL Queries), ASP.NET Web Forms.</p>

        <p>During Summer 2015, I worked at as a Software Engineering Intern at General Electric Transportation. I worked with the Heavy-Haul Locomotive Software Team, primarily on locomotive software simulation. My project involved developing &amp; improving a pre-existing tool to remotely load software into the simulation lab for testing. This allowed developers who wanted to run testing to load &amp; begin running the tests from their desks, rather than having to physically walk to the lab. I also helped develop tools for testing automation to simulate a locomotive operator. Primarily used PHP, C++, Bash Scripting, Python.</p>

        <p>Over the 2014-2015 school year, I worked at Stony Brook University.
        For the first half of the school year, I worked as a tutor for PHY 131 &mdash; Introductory Physics. I covered topics including mechanics, wave motion, and kinetic theory. Generally students would come to me with non-homework problems from their textbook, and I would help walk them through how it is done using socratic probing and other teaching methods. 
        Next I worked as a Lab TA for CSE 114 &mdash; Introduction to Java. The lab covered fundamental object oriented concepts in Java. Meeting twice a week, students would be assigned a lab to demonstrate understanding of topics covered. My role was to help students understand the lab, and more importantly how the principles would scale up.</p>
